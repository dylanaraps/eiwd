Station hierarchy
=================

Service		net.connman.iwd
Interface	net.connman.iwd.Station [Experimental]
Object path	/{phy0,phy1,...}/{1,2,...}

Methods		void Scan()

			Schedule a network scan.

			Possible errors: net.connman.iwd.Busy
					 net.connman.iwd.Failed

		void Disconnect()

			Disconnect from the network.  This also disables
			iwd from trying to autoconnect to any other network
			with this device.

			Possible errors: net.connman.iwd.Busy
					 net.connman.iwd.Failed
					 net.connman.iwd.NotConnected

		array(on) GetOrderedNetworks()

			Return the list of networks found in the most recent
			scan, sorted by their user interface importance
			score as calculated by iwd.  If the device is
			currently connected to a network, that network is
			always first on the list, followed by any known
			networks that have been used at least once before,
			followed by any other known networks and any other
			detected networks as the last group.  Within these
			groups the maximum relative signal-strength is the
			main sorting factor.

			Every record returned contains a tuple of the
			following values.

			object Object

				net.connman.iwd.Network object representing
				the network.

			int16 SignalStrength

				Network's maximum signal strength expressed
				in 100 * dBm.  The value is the range of 0
				(strongest signal) to -10000 (weakest signal)

		array(sns) GetHiddenAccessPoints() [experimental]

			Returns a list (possibly empty) of detected hidden
			access points.  The list is sorted according to the
			relative signal strength of each access point.

			Every record returned contains a 3-tuple of the
			following values.

			string Address

				Access Point's address

			int16 SignalStrength

				Access Point's signal strength expressed in
				100 * dBm.  The value is the range of 0
				(strongest signal) to -10000 (weakest signal)

			string Type

				The type of the hidden Access Point.  Same
				values as Network.Type.

		void ConnectHiddenNetwork(string ssid)

			Tries to find and connect to a hidden network for the
			first time.  Only hidden networks of type 'psk' and
			'open' are supported.  WPA-Enterprise hidden networks
			must be provisioned.

			The ssid parameter is used to find the hidden network.
			If no network with the given ssid is found, an
			net.connman.iwd.NotFound error is returned.

			In the unlikely case that both an open and pre-shared
			key hidden network with the given ssid is found an
			net.connman.iwd.ServiceSetOverlap error is returned.

			Once the hidden network is found, the connection will
			proceed as normal.  So the user agent will be asked
			for a passphrase, etc.

			This method should only be called once to provision
			a hidden network.  For all future connections the
			regular Network.Connect() API should be used.

			Possible errors: net.connman.iwd.Busy
					 net.connman.iwd.Failed
					 net.connman.iwd.InvalidArguments
					 net.connman.iwd.NotConfigured
					 net.connman.iwd.NotConnected
					 net.connman.iwd.NotFound
					 net.connman.iwd.ServiceSetOverlap
					 net.connman.iwd.AlreadyProvisioned
					 net.connman.iwd.NotHidden

		void RegisterSignalLevelAgent(object path,
						 array(int16) levels)

			Register the agent object to receive signal strength
			level change notifications on the
			net.connman.iwd.SignalLevelAgent interface, see
			signal-level-agent-api.txt.  The "levels"
			parameters decides the thresholds in dBm that will
			generate a call to the agent's Changed
			method whenever current RSSI crosses any of the
			values.  The values must be passed in descending
			order.  The number and distance between requested
			threshold values is a compromise between resolution
			and the frequency of system wakeups and
			context-switches that are going to be occuring to
			update the client's signal meter.  Only one agent
			can be registered at any time.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.Failed
					 [service].Error.AlreadyExists
					 [service].Error.NotSupported

		void UnregisterSignalLevelAgent(object path)

			Unregister an existing agent.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotFound

Properties	string State [readonly]

			Reflects the general network connection state.  One of:

			"connected", "disconnected", "connecting",
			"disconnecting", "roaming"

		object ConnectedNetwork [readonly, optional]

			net.connman.iwd.Network object representing the
			network the device is currently connected to or to
			which a connection is in progress.

		boolean Scanning [readonly]

			Reflects whether the device is currently scanning
			for networks.  net.connman.iwd.Network objects are
			updated when this property goes from true to false.

SignalLevelAgent hierarchy
==========================

Service		unique name
Interface	net.connman.iwd.SignalLevelAgent
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void Release(object device)

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			unregisters the agent. An agent can use it to do
			cleanup tasks. There is no need to unregister the
			agent, because when this method gets called it has
			already been unregistered.

		string Changed(object device, uint8 level)

			This method gets called when the signal strength
			measurement for the device's connected network
			changes enough to go from one level to another out
			of the N ranges defined by the array of (N-1)
			threshold values passed to
			net.connman.iwd.Device.RegisterSignalLevelAgent
			(see device-api.txt.)  The level parameter is in
			the range from 0 to N, 0 being the strongest
			signal or above the first threshold value in the
			array, and N being the weakest and below the
			last threshold value.  For example if
			RegisterSignalLevelAgent was called with the
			array [-40, -50, -60], the 'level' parameter of
			0 would mean signal is received at -40 or more dBm
			and 3 would mean below -60 dBm and might correspond
			to 1 out of 4 bars on a UI signal meter.
